        RecycleView

     
  What is a RecyclerView?

A RecyclerView is a flexible view for providing a limited window into a large data set. It is essentially a ViewGroup of containers called ViewHolders.RecyclerView is an extensive Android class to provide a flexible UI

BENEFITS :
----------
 benefit of using RecyclerViews is that you’re able to efficiently reuse views instead of managing items


Why we use RecyclerView?

A)Android was using ListView or GridView classes for displaying lists. The RecyclerView can be described as a combination of a ListView and a GridView.

Recycle Feature :  that separate your code into maintainable components while also enforcing memory-efficient design patterns.
-----------------

How is it better than ListViews and GridViews?
A)ListViews and GridViews are comparatively slower than RecyclerViews.


Layouts in RecyclerView :
-------------------------
RecyclerView still uses an Adapter to act as a data source. However, you have to create ViewHolders to keep references in memory.To provide a new view, RecyclerView either" creates a new ViewHolder object" to inflate the layout and hold those references, or it recycles one from the existing stack.

This is it why it’s called a RecyclerView!

The most important and interesting component of a RecyclerView is its LayoutManager

There are three types of Layout Managers by default:
-------------------------------------------------------

LinearLayoutManager:           Positions items to look like a standard ListView.
GridLayoutManager:             Positions items in a grid format similar to a GridView.
StaggeredGridLayoutManager:    Positions terms in a staggered grid format.

RecyclerView implementations requires:
--------------------------------------
A list of data objects to work with.
An XML file of the view item.
An adapter to bind that data to the views.
A ViewHolder to populate the UI view from the XML item file.


RecyclerView using GridLayoutManager :
-------------------------------------
recycler_view_items.layoutManager = LinearLayoutManager(this)   

If U want to present GridView the list and syntax :
----------------------------------------------------
 recycler_view_items.layoutManager = GridLayoutManager(this, 2)
