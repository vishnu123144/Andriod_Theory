providing services to clients from "outside".

Three ways to "Inject" services from outside

Constructor injection

method injection

field injection (property in kotlin)

constructor injection
class client (private val service1: Service1)
{
private var service2 : Service2?=null

lateinit var service3: Service3 //field injection

fun setService2(service2: Service2) //method injection
{
this.service2=service2
}
}
