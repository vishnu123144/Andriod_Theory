Testing:

 Three types of testing in android:

                           Tests

       Unit              Instrumentation       UI
      
     JUNIT               JUNIT               Expresso
     Mockito             Mockito

UNIT:

local unit tests are running in your local machine.
java virtula machine
logic based testing
junit5,mockito

Instrumentation:

similar to local unit test cases.
need a real device or emulator
junit4,mockito

UI:

simulate a person using your app
clicking a button
literally uses widgets
real device or emulator


androidtest (instrumentation & ui)-->Mockito,Junit,Expresso

test (Unit) -->Mockito,Junit


Local tests: 

Unit tests that run on your local machine only. 
These tests are compiled to run locally on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to minimize execution time.
If your tests depend on objects in the Android framework, we recommend using Robolectric. 
For tests that depend on your own dependencies, use mock objects to emulate your dependencies' behavior.

Instrumented tests:

 Unit tests that run on an Android device or emulator. 
These tests have access to instrumentation information, such as the Context for the app under test. 
Use this approach to run unit tests that have complex Android dependencies that require a more robust environment, such as Robolectric.
