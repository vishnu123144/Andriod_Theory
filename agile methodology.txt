///Eureka Server holds information about all client-service applications.​
eureka server: eureka server is used for registering microservices
The Eureka server is nothing but a service discovery pattern 
implementation,
api gateway: api gateway is used for dynamic routing

CI service is a part of GitLab that build and test the software 
whenever developer pushes the  code  to application :
CI allows the project team members to integrate their work daily
 ,so that the integration errors can be identified 
easily by an automated build.///


We adopted agile methodology to work on our product development.​

We worked on our product in two sprints.​

In the first sprint we made the architecture, mock uis and made the
 backend services.​

And in the second sprint we made UI of our product.​

​


agile is an incremental and iterative approach to management.
agile is used for continuos collaboration of product.

A great benefit you can get from iterative work is less work wasted.




for implementing agile we are using scrum

scrum:

iterative over the developments and development one at a time.

scrum is a iteration of plan, build,test and review.

product owner:
is the guy with ideas and owner of the application he might not be a technical holds the responsibility 
to make sure 
that application is deployed
application is built exactly as the way it has to be built 


product backlog:
in a traditonal environment it has been planned for months and you are working and deploying 
depending upon the size of the product

in product backlog the small application iterated over smaller tasks
first iteration we will have plan ,build, test,and review 
in this case i am not building the whole application 

scrum master and product owner will come up with the product backlogs
scrum master and product owner will give user stories 

sprint meeting:

sprint planning is nothing but meeting and discussions you have
During the sprint planning meeting, the team selects some number of product
 backlog items, usually in the form of user stories,
 and identifies the tasks necessary to complete each user story.
 Most teams also estimate how many hours each task will take someone on the
 team to complete.

//scrum master:
scrum master is some one project manager or team manager who held the meetings daily
 or handling the tasks//


daily scrum:
daily scrum is nothing more thanyou know the 15 minute meeting that
 happened every day 
which has been assigned role you
 have what happened and where you stand if you need 
any help there 
what you plan today 

7) Sprint Retrospective
There has to be a clear next step after every step if you want Agile project management to work.
 This can be determined via a sprint retrospective. 
After completing a sprint and showing off all features,
 it’s now time to figure out what gets done next.

sprint review:
sprint review will occurs at the end of user stories 
or the backlog you working on each and 
every one of the user stories with timeline odf two weeks in
 mind at the end of two weeks
once the sprint is completed we have a sprint review demo the code 
you have or some kind of
verification that you actually completed
