Activity:
       A single screen in the application with ui components user will interact
with the device through one activity.


Service:
  A long running background process with out any user interaction.
  If u want to perform any operations in background we can write the
 code in service

Broadcast Receivers:

-Broadcast Receivers are registered with system announcements.

headset plugin,charger connected/disconnected,screen ON/OFF.


Content Provider:

   Content provider is used to share the data between 
         multiple applications.

   In android one of the security feature is we cannot acees one
 apllication data with another application directly but if the application is
providing the content provider then we can acess the data.

     X Application        Y application
      
     Contacts              watsup
      
      Sqlite database


from above example we can access the contacts data in watsup 
with the help of content provider.

Ex: Contacts,Callog,media,Settings,Calender
